1, Boil some pasta in a pan.
2. Take some white flour out and some butter.
3. Take out the pan you want to cook in and put the butter in first. When it melts completely put the white flour in.
4. When the flour and the butter start coming together add some milk. The flour will disolve into it and will start forming a sauce.
5. Take a seperate pan and put some butter in and add veggies to your choice. Add some salt and saute the veggies.
6. By now the pasta will be soft and cooked. Now take out a strainer and put it under cold water to stop the cooking.
7. Now put the veggies in the sauce along with the pasta.
8. Put spices the way you want but most preferably put salt, pepper, chillie flakes and oregano.
9. Serve the way you want.
